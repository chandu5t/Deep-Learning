# Deep Learning Lab Assignments  

This repository contains my **Deep Learning Lab Assignments** for the course **TY CSE AI**.  
Each assignment includes both the **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** with implementation and the **Report (.docx)** with explanations, theory, and results.

## üìÇ Assignments Overview  

1. **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**  
   - Implemented using Keras and TensorFlow  
   - Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits  
   - Goal: Classify digits using a simple FNN  

2. **Facial Recognition (Binary Classification)**  
   - Face detection with OpenCV + CNN model  
   - Dataset: LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) / custom dataset  
   - Goal: Classify images as *Face* / *Non-Face*  

3. **Image Classification using CNNs (Multiclass)**  
   - Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR-10 dataset  
   - Goal: Classify images into 10 categories (airplane, car, cat, etc.)  

4. **Time Series Prediction with RNN**  
   - RNN/LSTM model for stock market price prediction  
   - Dataset: Stock prices from Yahoo Finance (Tesla/Apple)  
   - Goal: Predict future closing prices  

5. **Text Identification with OpenCV + Tesseract OCR + DNN**  
   - Preprocessing using OpenCV  
   - Text recognition with Tesseract OCR  
   - Refinement using Deep Neural Network  
   - Goal: Extract and identify text from images (scanned docs, signboards)  

6. **Sentiment Analysis with LSTM/GRU**  
   - RNN-based model for sentiment classification  
   - Dataset: IMDB reviews / Twitter dataset  
   - Goal: Classify reviews as *Positive* or *Negative*  

7. **Object Detection with YOLO (Pretrained Model)**  
   - YOLOv8 pretrained model used for detection  
   - Dataset: COCO (Common Objects in Context)  
   - Goal: Detect multiple objects in images/videos
